# Selected Biostatistics R Exercises

This repository contains a selection of R programming exercises completed as part of biostatistics coursework. The exercises focus on developing statistical intuition through simulation, visualization, and probabilistic reasoning.

## Covered Topics

- Visualization and interpretation of correlation pitfalls (Anscombe-type datasets)
- Monte Carlo simulation of coin tossing and convergence behavior
- Simulation-based comparison of probabilistic games using binomial models

## Purpose

These exercises are included to demonstrate familiarity with core statistical concepts and reproducible R-based analysis, complementing larger project-based work.
